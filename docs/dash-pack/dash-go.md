3. If at any point you encounter an error with the equipment via any of the icons at the top right hand corner of the screen turning **<span style="color:red">RED</span>**, or if the scanning process is halted, refer to the Troubleshooting Guide.

<!-- Make a troubleshooting guide! -->

4. Ensure that you **DO NOT** make any sharp turns while walking, if you encounter a sharp corner during your walk, try to make a gradual turn. This minimises the inaccuracies in the data collected during the scan.

2. Once opened, you can rotate about the scanned environment through dragging one finger across the screen, and to maneuver around the scene, you can drag two fingers across the screen, which would move the camera against the direction that you drag.

3. If there are major misalignments present in the scan, perform the scan once again. If not, upload the scanned file onto the d.ASH Xplorer application to process the data collected.
