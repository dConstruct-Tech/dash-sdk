### 3.1.2

#### ^^Robot Power ON/OFF^^
This is an optional step depending on the type of robot you are running. For most robots the robot is automatically turned ON when you physically attach a battery ( or press the actual Power ON button/switch ). For robots that need to be turned ON via software ( like the **Boston Dynamics Spot** ), you should turn it on by pressing the **Power ON** button before piloting the robot. Similary, you can **Power OFF** the robot if it supports such functionality.

#### ^^Robot Reconnection/Restart ( Connectivity issues )^^
If you encounter situations where you lose connection to the robot ( or encounter unstable video/control streams ), you should consider **Restarting/Reconnecting** with the robot. There are 2 options available:

| ![Screenshot](img/actions-menu.png){ align=center style="width:200px"} |

- **Reconnect:** This issues a fast reconnection between the pilot client and the robot. Run this if you suspect there was issue with connectivity between the client and the robot.
- **Full Restart:** This will flush + restart the robot system, then reconnect the client to the robot when the robot system is ready. Run this if you need to do a full restart with the robot possibly due to issues other than connectivity.

### 1.4 ^^Control Panel^^

### 1.10 ^^RTSP Streaming^^
This button allows you to start a RTSP stream which can be used to broadcast camera footage from the robot to clients. [FFMPEG](https://ffmpeg.org/about.html) is required for this feature. However, FFMPEG is not packaged with Dash Pilot. If you would like to use RTSP streaming, please [download FFMPEG here](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and move ffmpeg.exe to the Dash Pilot Application's data folder. This is typically located in C:\Program Files (x86)\Dash Pilot.

| ![Screenshot](img/ffmpeg-location.jpg){ align=center style="width:500px"} | 

There are several settings for customising the RTSP stream.
