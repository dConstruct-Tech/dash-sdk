### 1. Application Functionalities


d.ASH Nav is the platform for autonomous control of robots. Being seamlessly integrated in the d.ASH Fleet Management workflow, you can enjoy easy planning and deployment of your robots for various use cases. d.ASH Nav allows you to plot waypoints for autonomous navigation on maps, tracking and monitoring path planning, as well as overall monitoring of your robots.

Because d.ASH Nav is fully integrated with d.ASH Fleet Management system, an internet connection is required. Should you require d.ASH Nav without an internet connection, please contact us for more details.

### 3.1 Setting up your robot 

| Instructions |
| ------- | 
| <div class="instructions-div"><div class="instruction-circle">1</div><p style="margin: 0; margin-left: 5px;">Turn ON your robot</p></div><font size="3"><font size="2"> For most robots, they are automatically turned ON when you physically attach a battery and press the Power ON button/switch. For robots that need to be turned ON via software (such as the Boston Dynamics Spot), please follow the specific instructions found in the robot manufacturer's website. |
| <div class="instructions-div"><div class="instruction-circle">2</div><p style="margin: 0; margin-left: 5px;">Connect to the robot's WiFi network</p></div><font size="3"><font size="2"> Open your mobile device's settings app, click on Connections -> Wi-Fi, and then connect to the network of your robot. After succesful connection, there should be 'Connected without internet' below the Wi-Fi network. If there is no network found, it means your robot has not been turned on properly. |
| <div class="instructions-div"><div class="instruction-circle">3</div><p style="margin: 0; margin-left: 5px;">Return to the application. On the left hand side, click on this button to select your robot.</p></div><font size="3"><font size="2"><img src="img/select-robot.png" style="margin-top: 10px;" /> |
| <div class="instructions-div"><div class="instruction-circle">4</div><p style="margin: 0; margin-left: 5px;">Select the robot that you intend to use.</p></div><font size="3"><font size="2"> If your robot is not found, please refer to our troubleshooting guide in <a href="#">Section 5</a> or contact us. |

### 4. View, Plan and Ready Tabs 

<img src="img/option-panels.png" style="margin-top: 10px; width: 300px;"/>

### 4.1 View Tab
In this view tab, you will find options to change the view and configurations of the map imported into the application. 

#### 4.1.1 Adjusting the map view  
Pinch to zoom in and out <br>
Swipe to adjust view <br>
Swipe with two fingers to move around <br>

Select this button on the top left to reset view to default. <br>
<img src="img/reset-view.png" style="margin-top: 10px;"/>

#### 4.1.2 Clipping 
Move the points on the range slider to adjust how much floor/ceiling is shown on the map of your application. <br>
<img src="img/clipping.png" style="width: 600px; margin-top: 10px;" />

#### 4.1.3 Contours
Toggle on and off or adjust the contour level to change the amount of detail in data points. <br>
<img src="img/contour.png" style="width: 600px; margin-top: 10px;"/>


#### 4.1.4 Example of a good map visualization
The view tab is entirely used to change the way you see the map on the application and it is up to you on how you want to configure it. Leaving it as default is alright as well. But usually, you should adjust the thumbs such that the floor of the map is visible and the ceiling of the map is hidden but the artifects are still visible. 

### 4.2 Ready Tab
Inside this tab is where you find the functions to control your 

### 4.2.1 Live camera streaming 
To see your robot's camera view, select or toggle the camera options here. This can be found in the options menu on the right. 

<img src="img/cameras.jpg" style="width: 300px;"> 

### 4.2.2 Manually controlling your robot 
To move your robot, switch the control mode at the bottom of the application to manual mode.
<img src="img/control-mode-toggle.png" style="width: 300px; margin-top: 10px;" />

Use the joysticks to move the robot. The joystick on the left is used to move the robot front and backwards, while the right joystick is used to turn the robot left and right. 

<img src="img/manual-control-mode.jpg" style="width: 400px;"/>

### 4.2.3 Localizing your robot 

Before we move on to the functionalities in the planning and ready tabs,  we will need to localize our robot. 

Localizing would ensure that our robot knows its exact location in real life and a good localization would ensure that we know where our robot is without actually looking at it in real life. 

| Instructions |
| ------- | 
| <div class="instructions-div"><div class="instruction-circle">1</div><p style="margin: 0; margin-left: 5px;">On the right side of the application, press the Localize button.</p></div><fonst size="3"><img src="img/localize-button.png" style="margin-top: 10px; width: 300px;"/><br><font size='2'>Ensure that you are on the ready tab. Here, you can also find your robot status and see information like the battery, localization and stance.|
| <div class="instructions-div"><div class="instruction-circle">2</div><p style="margin: 0; margin-left: 5px;">Localize the robot based on its actual position in real life from the map.</p></div><font size="3"><font size="2"> Press on the point of the map where the robot is located and drag it to the direction it is facing. Then, use the directional arrows to adjust it to fit the map.<img src="img/localize-demo.gif" style="margin-top: 10px;"> Alternatively, you can use the rotation button to adjust and improve your localizations. <img src="img/localize_rotation.gif" style="margin-top: 10px;"/>|

Some good robot localization examples are shown below.

<img src="img\localization.png" style="width: 600px; margin-top: 10px;"/>

Good localization is where the robots LIDAR visualization (white points) lines up with the map. 

`Make another example image as this image is not clear`

`Explain why its good localization and why its bad`

### 4.3 Plan Tab
The planning tab is for preparing routes for robot autonomy. 

### 4.3.1 Creating your route
Before starting, ensure that you have our localized your robot to the map. Refer to <a href="#">Section 4.2.3</a> for a guide on robot localization. <br>
At the bottom right corner of your screen, select on the 'App Route' button.

<img src="img/add-route-button.jpg" style="width: 300px;" /><br>
Give your new route a name, use a name that is descriptive.<br>
<img src="img/add-new-route.jpg" style="width: 300px; margin-top: 10px;" />

</div>
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-top: -15px;">
    <img src="img/pointer.png" alt="Functionality Icon" height="20">
    <p style="padding-top: 16px; padding-left: 10px;">High : LIDAR spins at its fastest rate, which makes the resulting scan the most detailed.</p>
</div>

### 4.3.1.1.2 Image Capture Mode
<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-top: -15px;">
    <img src="img/pointer.png" alt="Functionality Icon" height="20">
    <p style="padding-top: 16px; padding-left: 10px;">None : Does not utilize the camera for capturing images.</p>

<div style="display: flex; align-items: center; margin-top: -15px;">
    <img src="img/pointer.png" alt="Functionality Icon" height="20">
    <p style="padding-top: 16px; padding-left: 10px;">HDR (High Dynamic Range) : More detail in both highlights and shadows can be captured. </p>
</div>

### 4.3.1.1.3 Generating BLK scan points 
Here is where we select the points in our map to apply a BLK scan.
<img src="img/generate-scan-points-slider.jpg" style="width: 300px;" />

`Select points for scan image/gif`<br>

Points that are blinking??? indicate the points that robot will scan???

### 4.3.1.2 Setting route by waypoints
To set your route, you can do it by manually making waypoints for the robot to follow. To do this, select the Add Mode button at the bottom of the screen. 

<img src="img/selected-add-mode.jpg" style="width: 300px;"><br>
<img src="img/setting-route-by-waypoint.gif" style="width: 400px;">

If you want to delete a waypoint, select the Remove Mode button, and click on the waypoints that you would like to delete. <br>
<img src="img/selected-remove-mode.jpg" style="width: 300px; margin-top: 10px;"><br>
Finally, select the Done button when you are finished with setting your route. 

### 4.3.1.3 Setting route by controlling your robot
Add a new route and give it a name. Once you've created a new route, exit by pressing the done button. <br>
On the bottom right of your map navigation screen, click on this button. <br>
<img src="img/record-route-button.jpg" style="width: 70px; margin-top: 10px;"> <br>
<img src="img/record-route-view.jpg" style="width: 300px;" />


### 4.3.2 Editing or deleting your routes
