It encompasses the interactive visual components for d.ASH's software and displays different elements for users to interact with to control your robot. This section of the d.ASH SDK documentation provides details about setting up the d.ASH autonomy controller, including information on its respective components. 1.1 Main Components Component Description (1) Main toolbar : Used to open other menus. (2) Slider : Used to move floor grid up and down. 3) Access mode : Used switch to mouse/keyboard mode. (3) (a) Navigation : The default mode uses the keys WASD to move camera and right click the mouse to zoom/tilt the camera. (3) (b) Waypoint creation : Used for adding waypoints to routes. (4) Floor grid 1.2 Login Component Description The login icon allow dConstruct users to log into the d.ASH autonomy controller using their cloud admin credentials. 1.3 Robot Connection The robot connection icon allow users to connect/disconnect their respective robots to the d.ASH autonomy controller. Component Description (1) Online pannel : Select from a list of robots that are online and ready to be used to connect to. (2) Connected pannel : Select from a list of robots that you have connected to in the client to manipulate. (3) Add button : Press to connect to the robot selected in the online list to add the robot to the connected list. (4) Minus button : Press to disconnect from a robot in the connected list. When users first start the d.ASH SDK, they need to give an initial estimation of the robot's post on the map by configuring its init pose . It tells the robot where its rough initial position is. To initialize init pose , draw the orange arrow by left clicking and drag the mouse on the floor grid. 1.4 Routes The routes icon allow users to set routes for the robot to follow using waypoints. Add/remove waypoints to build your own custom routes. 1.4.1 Route Controls Component Description (1) Route name pannel : Enter route name to add. (2) Add button : Click to add route of given name. (3) Route selection pannel : Click to select a route. (4) Minus button : Press to disconnect from a robot in the connected list. (5) Waypoint button : Click to add waypoints to selected route. (6) Load/save button : Load/save all routes. (7) Segment pannel : Use keypad \u00b1 to increment/decrement segment number. 1.4.2 Setting Up Routes Component Description To make a selected robot follow a selected route, add waypoints by clicking on the grid. Use WASD and right-click on the mouse to manipulate the view. Once the waypoints have been set, exit waypoint mode by middle clicking the mouse. On the other hand, to remove a waypoint, click on the waypoint (selected waypoint change to the color orange), and press the delete ket to remove. You can also adjust the elevation of the grid by pressing the key ctrl and the mouse scroll moving the floor grid in waypoint mode. A waypoint is created when you click on grid, so, to create elevated waypoints, move grid up/down and then click. 1.5 Map Settings The map settings icon allow users to adjust highpass, lowpass, UV Scale, and UV offset settings to customise the visuals of your map. Component Description Low pass slider : Voxels below this value is visible. Voxels in maps have elevation, and by lowering the low pass, voxels above the low pass will be cropped. Notice that the ceiling voxels have now been cropped by reducing the low pass. 1.6 Layer Visibility Component Description The layer visibility icon allow users to toggle the visibility of various items on the map. 1.7 Load Scans The load scans icon allow users to preview scans from the d.ASH Pack. Component Description (1) Vox downsample size pannel : Select your down sample size (in metres). A large value means lower quality, but faster loading. (2) Point clouds button : Pick loaded point clouds to toggle translucency..

RealsenseCam, TestCam . retrieveImg : Enables image retrieval. map_name : Map name used for autonomy (as mentioned in File Organisation ). pc_topic : ROS point cloud topic name for subscribing. odom_topic : ROS odometry topic name for subscribing. 3.2.2 Controller linear_window : Sets DWA (dynamic window approach) size For the following parameters, ensure the value is within limits of the robot. linear_min_v : Sets minimum linear velocity for autonomy. linear_max_v : Sets maximum linear velocity for autonomy. angular_max_w : Sets maximum angular velocity for autonomy. linear_max_a : Sets maximum linear acceleration for autonomy. angular_max_a : Sets maximum angular acceleration for autonomy. For the following parameters, ensure the vlaues are align with the robot as per its documentation. robot_width : Reflects width of robot. robot_length : Reflects the length of robot. obstacle_cost_gains : Sets weight for an obstacle course based on the weighted sum of the map. speed_cost_gains : Sets weight for speed cost. goal_cost_gains : Sets weight for goal cost. angular_speed_cost_scaling_factor : Sets weight for angular velocity. Note that a higher value of the variable discourages the robot from turning. Note that a higher value of the variable slows down the computations. linear_num_window_steps : Sets number of linear velocity values to consider. angular_num_window_steps : Sets number of angular velocity values to consider. prediction_window : Sets prediction horizion (in seconds). costmap_size : Sets local costmap size (in meters). costmap_scale : Sets scale to convert map from meter to pixels. Note that the point cloud height is measured from the center of the lidar. If the ground is detected, it will be considered as an obstacle. Therefore, set the minimum value to be above the ground. max_pc_height : Sets maximum point cloud height to be considered as an obstacle. min_pc_height : Sets minimum point cloud height to be considered as an obstacle. Do not remove too much from the point cloud filter as obstacles around the robot might not be considered. x_filter : Sets vector of size 2 consisting the minimum and maximum x-value of point cloud to be removed. y_filter : Sets vector of size 2 consisting the minimum and maximum y-value of point cloud to be removed. Note that a higher value of the variable results in more conservative planning. costmap_obs_inflation : Sets inflation radius of obstacles to be considered in planning. occ_obs_deadzone : Sets minimum distances from obstacles and robots for autonomy. dt : Sets timestep. Note that a higher timestamp slows down the computation. visualise : Enables visualisation of costmap.
